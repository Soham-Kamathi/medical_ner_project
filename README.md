# 🏥 Medical Report Analyzer

A Streamlit-based web application for extracting, analyzing, and storing medical information from PDF reports using state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) models. The app supports uploading medical PDFs, extracting patient details, performing NER on the content, and storing results in a MySQL database for search and statistics.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **PDF Upload:** Upload one or more medical PDF reports.
- **Text Extraction:** Extracts text from uploaded PDFs using PyMuPDF.
- **Patient Details Extraction:** Automatically extracts patient name, age, and gender.
- **Named Entity Recognition:** Uses HuggingFace NER models (default: `d4data/biomedical-ner-all`) to identify medical entities.
- **Database Storage:** Stores patient details and extracted entities in a MySQL database.
- **View Reports:** Browse all stored reports and their extracted entities.
- **Search Reports:** Search reports by patient name, ID, or medical entity.
- **Statistics:** Visualize the frequency of extracted medical entities.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Soham-Kamathi/medical_ner_project.git
cd medical-report-analyzer
```

\
### 2. Install Python dependencies

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, use:**

```bash
pip install streamlit pymupdf mysql-connector-python transformers pandas
```

### 3. Set up MySQL

- Install MySQL and start the server.
- Create a database named `medical_ner`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE medical_ner;
```

- Update the MySQL connection parameters in `medical_App.py` if needed (host, user, password).

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change the NER Model

At the top of `medical_App.py`, set the model you want to use:

```python
MODEL_NAME = "d4data/biomedical-ner-all"  # Or any other HuggingFace NER model
```

You can find more models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=token-classification).

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I change the NER model?**  
A: Edit the `MODEL_NAME` variable at the top of `medical_App.py`.

**Q: I get a MySQL connection error!**  
A: Make sure your MySQL server is running and the credentials in the script are correct.

**Q: The app says "Data too long for column 'age'"!**  
A: The app now extracts only numeric age values. If you still get this error, check your database schema and the extracted data.
